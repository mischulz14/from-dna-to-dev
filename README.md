# DNA TO DEV - PART OF MY DEV STORY

## Hey there! 
This is a small game I made (but it took a long time!) to show some of my past and how I came to the decision to learn programming. 
I wrote this game with Typescript and the Phaser 3 framework for Javascript Gamedevelopment. 
If you have any question about the code or want tipps on how to handle some weird Phaser behaviors, you can reach out to me [here](michaelschulz.tech).

### OOOH and btw - All of the art assets are drawn and animated by me so please ask if you want to use them! Thanks (:
